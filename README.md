## Introduction
This is Brainfuck interpreter written in Rust. It contains all vanilla Brainfuck commands and new added ones. I know that they are not in spirit of Brainfuck, but it's just for fun.
It is just some funny project, not for real usage.

## Usage
- To use this interpreter download source files and compile it with rust or download precompiled program from Releases
- Then run it from console/terminal with path to file with Brainfuck code in argument eg.
```
.\BrainRust.exe .\code.bf
```
